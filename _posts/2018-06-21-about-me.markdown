**I'**m a software engineer hailing from the northern part of India. I taught myself programming and web development while living in a farm at the outskirts of Bangalore, before transitioning myself into a full-stack developer role. 

I aspire to be a true digital nomad, travelling to places and having interesting experiences.


### Things I love:

* Vipaasana
* Unicycling
* Fitness
